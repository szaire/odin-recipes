        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Great simple pasta dish. Good to have the night before a race. This
            is also good with sauteed shrimp.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
            <li>¬º cup olive oil</li>
            <li>8 slices bacon, cut into 1/4 inch pieces</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>¬Ω chup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

            <li>
                Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a
                rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in
                the spaghetti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered,
                stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but
                is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a
                colander set in the sink.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium
                heat. Stir in the bacon, and cook until the bacon has begun to
                shrink, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic, and continue cooking
                and stirring until the garlic has softened, and the bacon is
                crisp, about 5 minutes. Toss the drained pasta with the bacon,
                oil, and parsley to serve.
