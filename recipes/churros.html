        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Churros (Mexican fritters) are very common at fairs. In my border
            hometown, the line at this stand is always overwhelming. People wait
            hours in line just to get a taste of these churros. I have run
            across several recipes but this is the best one by far.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 Â½ tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 quarts oil for frying</li>
            <li>Â½ cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine water, 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons
                vegetable oil in a small saucepan and place over medium heat.
                Bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Stir in flour,
                stirring until mixture forms a ball.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F
                (190 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium
                star tip. Carefully pipe a few 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into
                the hot oil; work in batches so you don't crowd the fryer. Cook
                until golden; use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer churros
                to paper towels to drain.
