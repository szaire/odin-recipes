        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>3 cups half-and-half</li>
            <li>Pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and half of the
                sugar. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a medium saucepan, stir together the cream, half-and-half,
                salt, and remaining sugar. Heat the mixture over medium-high
                heat, stirring often, until it comes to a simmer, then reduce
                heat to medium.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add about 1/2 cup of the cream mixture to the egg mixture while
                whisking constantly (this helps prevent the eggs from cooking).
                Repeat with another 1/2 cup of the cream mixture.
            </li>
        </ol>
